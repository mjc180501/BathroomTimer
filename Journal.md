I designed the schematic with the nano, the MPU-6050 and LCD-016N002L, 4 push buttons, a 9V battery, and 1 LED. The MPU-6050 is connected to the nano with I2C and the LCD is connected differently. I also had to use a 10k potentiometer. 

I've been doing schematic -> CAD -> Code but I think I'm going to work on the code next because I am a bit worried about getting the MPU-6050 to work.

I finished writing the code. The user chooses one of the buttons when they close the door, which is recognized by the accelerometer. Each button corresponds to a different time. The timer counts down and the LED flashes when the time is up.

Due to travel, I haven't made much progress for the last week. But I made the full CAD today and started arranging the GitHub. I made some small changes to the code as I had some errors. Then I organized the CAD, Code, and Schematic folder.
